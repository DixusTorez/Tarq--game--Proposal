**Name of the game:**   
The name of the game is Taqs. I chose this name because it is the word for weather in Arabic and weather here refers to how much your character is willing to go through. It connects to the story in its entirety. 

**Core genre:** the main idea was supposed to be action and adventure. The adventure came from collecting codexes and talking to the inhabitants of the ships and either being pleasant or unpleasant. Action is very dependent on you actually being in the ship and walking around.

**Perspective:** this is very mouldable. It could be a text game or it could be a 3-d game. 

**Movement and abilities**: the idea is giving your character as much freedom as possible. Sliding, rolling, wall jumping, crouching, crawling, grappling and falling is all part of the plan. 

**Progression:** the idea is to have it be an open “world” where you can go back and speak to people. There should be a hardline date to where you make your decision or it should just be questing. Chase sequences should be apparent 

**Action and conflict:** combat, shooting, melee attacks. Examples are getting into fights that can range from shooting guns to even just picking up a rock and throwing it at someone.

**Aesthetics and tones:** a mix and match of many different aesthetics. from scifi to pixels to even a grotesque, surreal, and nightmarish aesthetic. Comedy should  be present.

**Challenge style:** reflexes, general knowledge on human interaction and exploration.

**Backstory**: it's too much to put on one general education of the game so I'll include more documents so you can look at your own time. Here's a sample:   
Basically you're going to go through the challenges of a Kaizoku attempting to take over a vastella. This includes going undercover, fighting, saving face and eventually betraying those you befriend. You start in the place by waking up from cryostasis. 

**Characters**: they are still a work in progress. I have the main character finished. The main character is Gastillo. Gastillo is of Mexican descent. He stands at a whopping six foot two and two hundred pounds. He has brown hair which he styles in a buzz cut. He has a multitude of augments, some of the more noticeable augments are Spyder\_Eys that add black dots to the front and back of his head. They give him the ability to see in infrared, night vision and thermal as well as the ability to zoom in on targets. Another noticeable augment is a Vocal Linguistic Box. This gives him the ability to speak in any dialect but with the drawback of voice glitches and scratches. His favorite outfits include a variation of leather jacket and baggy cargo pants.   
His attitude is more serious and focused. A kaizoku operative.  
Kyren, A kaizoku operative, Kaelen, Mavis, Voss, and  Rachel.

**Enemies**: include Cybernetic enhancement problems, Discrimination, and Security of the ship (in stealing prompts, and fighting when trying to take over the ship or protect the ship) there are no main antagonists but there should be a growing sense of dread as your decision comes closer.

**Target audiences**: the target audience for this game is mainly adults and late teens. This is because of the artstyle, theme, difficulty and gameplay.

What keeps the person playing: the main thing is the continuation of the story and making connections with the characters.

**What I hope they feel:** I hope the person playing this game feels dread, accomplishment, wonder and hopefully satisfaction.

**Sabrinen Empire: 2 kings 2 queens**  
An empire which came about due to a coup and a subsequent and violent end to another, this empire is primarily a mix between Asian and Middle Eastern cultures in both wear, **dialect** and in certain cases warfare. They are the owners of a multitude of different planets inside and outside of **Galactus Primero**. They have their **own currency** outside of the standard **Stardrop**. They have a massive army due to its policy of conscription. Al \- jua har is currently their most costly endeavor. Their efforts to **terraform** it has led to the loss of billions in the coffers of the kings and queens. So far their efforts have led to **people** at least being able to **live underground.**

**Sabrinen Soldier:**  
These soldiers are hard to pinpoint in their exact attitude of life due to the simple fact that there are so many. They can range from corrupt psychopaths to scared runaways and just normal people. The battle tactics that the generals use are primarily **meatwave attacks** and huge **artillery barrages**. A couple of issues plague the average sabrinen soldier. These issues are lack of communication between officials, bribing officials, **friendly fire**, lack of specialization and the constant need for more soldiers. Every soldier is either a grunt or an artillery man. On al- jua har they wear a **serwal**, long fitting **compression suits,** veils and goggles. All of these are in some way related to the **crest and color of the empire,** a **dark gold** and **black**. Weapons consist of anything, from **local weapons** to the official **lasiks** of the empire. The ships that the empire use are the **Droppers, Blast-Ships** and **Dreadnoughts** 

**Smugglers:**  
Factions within factions describe this faction. They mainly consist of **AWOL conscripts** and the occasional civilian. Many smugglers are there for riches and some but a rare few are there to, as genuinely as possible for a smuggler, help. Smugglers dip their toes into a multitude of "businesses" from trafficking to selling **illicit goods** as long as it pays there's an incentive. Typically smuggling is a manageable problem to deal with for a lot of political powers. Usually smuggling takes place on singular planets with **weaker factions**. The Kaizoku on the other hand have been dominating space. 

**The Kaizoku:**  
They are the first people to have **gone interplanetary** (since the **Drive Age**)  in regards to smuggling operations. **Legend** surrounds them due to the fact that they are so prolific and extravagant in their operations, some of these legends include killing dozens of Sabrinen soldiers with every operation they undertake, Smuggling millions of people, being the sole creators of certain **hyper drugs** and being the only people to have the ability to fight the Sabrinen Empire. In reality they are usually quiet and in the background. Most recently they have almost been hunted out to extinction this is due to their perceived legendary nature. They still hold some claim to fame due to the simple fact that they are able to hold and maintain **outposts** on different planets. Leadership of the Kaizoku consists of a **council** of primarily men.

**The Kaizoku Smuggler:**  
The Kaizoku smuggler is a rag-tag band of troops consisting of AWOL conscripts and normal people. Their equipment consists of leftover equipment from dead soldiers; essentially, they are scavengers. Some of the smugglers who are higher up wear antique helmets and even acquired Lasik through bribes. The one thing that gets them caught is hand signs. There are about two million people who actively smuggle, and millions more who don't show up as often but still run regardless. Main issues they face include a  lack of organization, leadership roles, and smaller numbers.  The ships a smuggler typically uses are **Blugills** and **Mantisellas**.

**Ships:**  
Vastella: The vastella is a primarily long-range ship. It's used to reach different planets. Its size and functions vary. The Hilos Empire built the largest ship during the “Drive Age”. It could carry millions of people and was nearly self-sufficient. The typical functions of a Vastella includes: Cryostasis, farming, Waste recycling, and some form of recreation. Usually, the only problem is refueling and protecting the behemoth of a ship. These ships are often subject to raids and usually have a “mini military” on them. This mini military carries simple manual weapons but has enough to hold back a medium-sized attack. Very few weapons are built into the ship. At times, Smugglers use them as a base of operations due to their longevity. The Sabrinen Empire uses them to transport people to terraformed planets. Almost every **empire** uses these ships. Customization of the ships includes **Holo-Screens** on the outside of the ship, more farming units, and paint. Variants: Luxury Vastella and “Refugee Vastella”

Dreadnought: The dreadnought is a creation credited to the Sabrinen Empire and the remnants of a project by the Hilos Empire. This ship is used for “Cracking” planets. It is used in Far Orbit and used to bombard planets into submission. They are extremely difficult and expensive to build.  Customization of the ships includes **Holo-Screens** on the outside and speakers. It carries a crew,all of whom are armed to some degree.  They only have functions on it for essential life and armaments. Some of these shells they carry are HER (high explosive rounds, EMP electro magnetic pulse, IER incendiary explosive rounds and AER acidic explosive rounds. Weaknesses include fuel usage and swarm problems. Only the rich and builder empires can build and maintain them. Variants: Factory Dreadnoughts, Fortress Class Dreadnoughts

Droppers: Droppers are used to transport troops directly to the ground. They are smaller ships but can cram up to 200 people in a single load. They eject people from the ship in pods, which are called graveyards, which then slam into the ground. The main problem is that these crafts are prone to being targeted immediately. In return,they are really fast. The motto of the ship, if it had one, would be in and out. Variants: Cargo Droppers and Evacuation Droppers

Carriers: Carriers, aptly named due to their use of carrying anything alive, dead, or inanimate,are more popularly used. They are massive, blending a mix of life support and carrying capacity. Their strengths include strong thrusters, decent support for life and defendability. Weaknesses include fuel mileage, long winding hallways, and constant attacks. Variants: Smuggle carriers, Scrappers, Recovery Carriers.

Blast-Ships: primarily used for artillery during orbit. Smaller than the dreadnought, therefore using less artillery shelling, but still useful. Used by the majority of empires,they can also be used to send soldiers from orbit,unlike the dreadnought. They are prone to malfunctions and blow up really easily due to the compact nature of the ship.

Mantisellas: these ships are fast, precise, and deadly. They look like flattened out hummingbirds. Primarily used by Sabrinen as suicide bombers or defenders. Also used by the smugglers for going fast across planets or to different planets. They are very customizable. For example, how the Sabrinen transforms it into a suicide ship is by adding explosives, a long needle and a welded shut cockpit. Smugglers change it to be used for speed only by taking out everything but the seat. Variants: Smuglsellas, Suicide Mantisellas and Sports mantisellas

Blugills: aptly named for their cheapness, reliability, and adaptability,these are blugills. Boxy and decently fast, almost everyone from smugglers, civilians, and even officers use this. Usually used for planet travel, they can get anyone anywhere at a decent speed. It can hold a decent amount of cargo and is loved by many for customization. Variants: cargo blugills, suicide blugills, Retrival blugills and smuggler blugills 

Glare-Shot: barely considered to be a ship by many, but the most popular out of Lasik tech. Using gravity tech to stay in orbit, they seat two people and only need a push of a button to shoot a laser from the sky. They are used in precise operations. They are prone to overheating like any lasik technology, and it gets hot in the cockpit. You can tell the people who fly this not only because they are hated due to the stigma of laziness, but the burns on hands and legs signify grueling work.

**Illicit Goods:** The production and sale of illicit goods is a problem for all empires. Each empire has a different definition of illicit goods and therefore provides lists, checkpoints and some form of leeway. Some primary examples of illicit goods that are profoundly hated by all empires are: Lasik smuggling, any military hardware, people, and “Hyper drugs”. Obviously,you can get around it with the right bribes to the right people, driving around checkpoints, or just merking everyone at a checkpoint and going on through.

**“Gone Interplanetary”:** This specific term refers to smugglers and other empires being able to get off their homeworld and move operations to other planets. With smugglers, this is typically a bad term because with the fame it gives it also gives you a target on your back. For empires, this gives access to opportunities that would never have been available otherwise,politically, culturally, money-wise wise and resource-wise.

**“Legend”:**  
 This term goes for anyone and anything. From ships, battles, wars, singular people, factions, and more, this is just a signifier that something has peaked and ingrained itself in a people's or empire's memory. Sometimes the ties go so deep it can make its way into history or even documents. 

**Weaker Factions:**  
Empires:  
Noches:  
Noches, rightly named for their laziness, are one of the more peaceful empires. Primarily a constitution of Hispanic and white influences of culture. They are the traders of the empire, dealing with anything valuable. With barely any military, you'd think they would've been crushed but no. they are the neutral ground of everything. They have outposts on mineral planets, water places and invest in a mutual relationship with the agriduns. Weaknesses they face is corruption, attacks on trade routes,s and raids on outposts. Their crest is a purple moon from their mainworld. 

Lando’s:  
Tech-based and the cowboys of space. They lean into it, going as far as to make body mods for people to use. Replacing what is organic with what is not is a specialty for them. Armies consist of robotic monstrosities to automated mantisellas. They have good relations with noches due to the lando’s constant need for minerals. Weaknesses they face is general prejudice due to their robotic supremacy ideas and constant fighting with platers. Primary outposts include mineral belts, silicon worlds, and certain star fields. Their crest is a blue motherboard signifying the legendary first chip implanted into their founder's head.

Agriduns:  
The feudalists. They take immense pride in what they do. That pride comes from farming. They grow anything and sell it to anyone. Primary dealers include Noches and smugglers. Primary outposts include dirt worlds and other fertile places. Weaknesses include a lack of technological proficiency and the fractured nature of their empire. Constant war on a worldly scale is a problem due to the feudal nature of the empire. Most refugees come from here. Their crest is a scythe signifying the hard work it takes to use it. The colors are green and grey

Plater:   
Platers just hate anything that isn't them. Constantly at war, they would have been considered smugglers if they weren't so expansive and organized. They barely trade and are in a constant war with anyone who isn't part of their empire. Outposts range anywhere because no one is willing to trade with them. Weaknesses are general hatred of them from anyone and being forced to be self-reliant due to the constant waring nature. Their crest is supposed to represent a lavas cracking after cooling.  Their colors are red and black. 

Smugglers:  
Mente:  
Primarily fighters, they barely go off-world. They fight with anyone they come across, and they are general isolationists. They are primarily composed of platers. 

Buq'ah:  
Huge, fleeting ships are why they got their name. Primarily an offworld smuggling operation, they use Vastellas for everything. They utterly hate the Kaizuko and are constantly fighting with them. They seemingly appeared out of nowhere,making people wonder if the kaizuko were larger and had a split or if they were planted there by the Sabrinen Empire. Consists of the lando empires, people, and the noches.

**Drive Age:**  
Refers to the time in human history when people took to the stars in mass after testing and building ships. Very technologically advanced and extremely cooperative right till the end of this age. People of this age created autonomous vehicles, which were AI-driven to navigate ships, while Vastellas flew to planets and landed for colonization. Before this time, places were driven manually, which would make room for error and sometimes even death. 

**Local Weapons:**  
While being a broad term it's actually really simple. Most of the civilian populus has some form of firepower. Very rarely is it lasik tech. It's more on the primitive side than being “Manual Weapons”. A manual weapon is something needing gas to shoot an ordinance. Some of the favorite “Manuals” (local name shortening) used on a lot of planets are

**Lasiks:**  
Considered the pinnacle of human technology, only overshadowed by the hyper drive, these are the most wanted, expensive and highly in demand weapons in the galaxy. They are a laser weapon which concentrates heat into a single focal point, and beams blast it out with mirrors at the desired target. These can take down ships, people and are used to cut holes, engineer, terraform and in some cases farm. The downsides mainly consist of telling burns on hands, overheating and being fragile not being able to take multiple hits. Lasiks can range from handguns, swords and rifles to the lovely glare shot ship. 

**Terra Form:**  
Terra Form means not to make comfortable but to make livable. There are three levels to terraforming the first being the idea stage. This stage includes how empires get the organisms, elements and lasiks to make it happen. They also need time. The second stage is the acting stage which includes lasik usage, organism releasing and elemental bonding. The final stage is to just wait and hope nothing goes bad. 

**Stardrop:**  
The standard currency of the galaxy. Almost every world uses some form of different currency but the stardrop is considered the primary one and can be used on every planet unless you're a Sabrinen. Sabrinen uses a different currency standard considered very annoying due to its constant fluctuations with both inflation and deflation.

**Living Underground:**  
This is the primary way people are able to live on semi terraformed worlds. The exact make up and look of each bunker varies from empire to empire. It could range from absolute luxury of the Noches empire including farms not only for sustenance but for recreation to the sabrinen empires massive bunkers hosting pods for sleep and living and having just enough food to keep living. 

**Important Cities:**

**Leaders:**

**Customs:**

**Tribes:** 

**Legends:**

**Characters:**

**Holo Screens:**

**Minerals (valuable ones):**

**Laws:**  
Noches:  
Relying on a bureaucratic money based voting system the Noches empire has what is most likely the least trustworthy voting system. Their laws require a mix of prioritizing money making and luxury prioritization. Some laws include Stable Working Hours, Files For Longer Working Hours, and finally the Requirement Of Head Implants to limit distraction. Bodily autonomy unless somehow useful to the production of money is very frowned upon. They have the closest system to old earth in regard to politics but with an emphasis on money. Paper work on Paper work.

Landos:

Agriduns:  
Relying on very feudalistic ideals they primarily rely on physical labor. Because of this they prioritize the longevity of life. Their laws ban the use of all substances, encourage the use of augments, require at least one child per woman, no birth control, require at least some form of spirituality and the total loyalty of their people. They are ruled by a council of people rather than a leader. Council seats are birthright positions. Currently 4 “Houses”, houses being main clans in the agridun empire, have a total of 16 seats. Almost every law is passed, brought up, debated on and created between these people. Almost no actual civilian involvement.  

Platers:
