Logic Point A — Player Movement Inside the Vastella Ship

Player movement matters because the ship contains narrow hallways, restricted zones, and dangerous drops (such as falling from the cryostasis pod).

Boundary Cases
Boundary Input	Why It’s a Boundary
Tile/coordinate less than 0	Player tries to move off-grid or into walls.
Tile/coordinate equal to max grid size	Player is at very edge of map.
Movement into a restricted security-only zone	Unexpected or illegal movement.
Test Data
Boundary Input	Test Data Example
Below grid minimum	Player attempts to move to (-1, 12)
At grid maximum	Player stands at (49, 0) on a 0–49 grid
Entering restricted zone	Moving into Security Room A without authorization
Expected Outcomes
Boundary Input	Test Data	Expected Outcome
<0 movement	(-1, 12)	Game blocks move; displays warning; no crash.
Max boundary	(49, 0)	Player can stand and move along the edge normally.
Restricted zone	Moving into Security Room A	Trigger security suspicion or confrontation; possibly game over.
Logic Point B — Player Health & Injury System

Health determines survival during fights with security, bullies, or augment malfunctions.

Boundary Cases
Boundary Input	Why It’s a Boundary
HP = -1	Health below zero (should never happen).
HP = 0	Exact death threshold.
HP above max (e.g., 101/100)	Impossible healing or logic bug.
Test Data
Boundary Input	Test Data Example
HP < 0	HP set to -1 after cybernetic malfunction
HP = 0	HP reaches 0 after fight with security
HP > max	Healing inject gives +30, pushing HP to 120
Expected Outcomes
Boundary Input	Test Data	Expected Outcome
Negative HP	-1 HP	Game clamps to 0; triggers death/game over.
Zero HP	0 HP	Death/game over screen appropriate to story branch.
Over max HP	120/100 HP	Clamp to max HP; no overflow; no stat corruption.
Logic Point C — Codex Inventory & Item Interaction

Codex and inventory are essential for clues, augment upgrades, and story interactions.

Boundary Cases
Boundary Input	Why It’s a Boundary
Inventory = 0 items	Player starts with nothing.
Inventory = maximum slots (full)	Cannot pick up more items.
Wrong item type	Player interacts with “non-pickup” object.
Test Data
Boundary Input	Test Data Example
Empty inventory	Player tries to use an item but inventory = []
Full inventory	20/20 items; tries to pick up Augment Module
Wrong item type	Player attempts to add Cryo Pod as a codex entry
Expected Outcomes
Boundary Input	Test Data	Expected Outcome
Empty inventory use	Use item with []	Game says “No item to use”; no crash.
Inventory full	Pick up Augment Module	“Inventory Full” message; item remains on ground.
Wrong item type	Cryo Pod → codex	Game plays error sound; disallows; does not corrupt inventory.
